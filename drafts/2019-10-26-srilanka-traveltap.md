*Written by Amy Quinton and Daniel Newman*

Have you always assumed if it's not safe to drink the tap water while traveling, then you must rely on purchasing single-use bottled water? Well luckily for you, we have discovered that is not always the case! There are often far better, (and less wasteful) alternatives.

We discovered that the best option for longer term or regular travellers is to have your own water purifier bottle or system like a steri-pen so you are always covered. Our fav all-in-one solution for this is this simple [“Travel Tap” water purifying systems][1] which you can get from Amazon. But if you don’t have one, never fear.

In Sri Lanka we discovered this nifty map https://getwater.lk that helps you find clean water refills and also lets you record new hidden clean water refill treasures that you discover, to benifit others!

There are many water re-fill stations where you can fill-up with clean fresh water, rather than purchasing bottled. Below are four popular tourist destinations where we found refill stations. These are just a few examples that we stumbled accross and there are many more options around the country as shown here https://getwater.lk. 

If you know of any more let me know or add them here https://getwater.lk youself

## Arugambay

On the main street in Arugambay you will find a free water refill station called [WLAB][6] :droplet:

### How we discovered this
We simply walked past it on our way to lunch! We later learned that many local businesses on the street refill here. We had already purchased a 5 litre bottle of water from the super market. So we took that bottle and a smaller bottle to re-fill several times during the rest of our stay. There is a donation box where you can make a contribution towards the plastic reduction initiative. 

## Trincomalee

[Verified clean water lines][2] are installed at most accomodation and restaurants in the area. Just ask your accomodation for access to their verified clean water line where you can re-fill your bottle for free. The water tasted great and we had no issues :thumbsup: It is important to ask otherwise restaurants/accomodation seem to assume tourists whould rather single-use plastic bottles :thumbsdown:

### How we discovered this

We were chatting with a restaurant owner at Nilaveli Beach about plastic pollution and he told us most places in the area have something that he called a '[sofia line][2]’ that provides verified clean water to the property. A what in the who know?! How did we not know about this?! We asked our guest house and sure enough they had a line and showed us where we could refill our bottles with clean, fresh, safe water for free! They told us it was mandatory for them to have that water line. It was separate water line to the guest rooms and there was one clean tap available outside (and one in the Kitchen) :potable_water:


## Anuradhapura

You can refill at many of the local general stores in town for 3 LKR per litre. A one litre plastic bottle is about 70 LKR, so 3 LKR is quite a saving!

### How we discovered this
We asked if the guest house had a clean water line like in Trinco. Our host said that wasn’t available in the area, and told us he re-fills his water drums for the kitchen in town for 3 LKR per litre. He took us to the general store to re-fill our water that afternoon (on our way to sightseeing) and even lent us one of his 7 litre drums to use during our stay. So ask your accommodation where you can refill or if you can refill from their clean water supply (Depending on the situation, you could offer an amount, like 5 LKR per litre, to cover water costs).

## Sigiriya

There are at least two re-fill stations here, one in the Village and one inside the main entrance to Lion Rock.

### How we discovered this
Venturing out to dinner we were delighted to stumble across a water station outside the school in Sigirya Village. The next day we took our bottles and refilled them before visiting Lion Rock. We could have saved ourselves the extra walk however because on arrival to Lion Rock we discovered there was another refill station inside the main tourist entrance! We thought this was great but we wondered how people would know about this in advance? At least they can refill here rather than buy more water later on. And hopefully it is only a matter of time before it is more widely publicised.

## Unawatuna Beach, Galle
[The hideout cafe and restaurant][3] has free fresh water 

## Mirissa

[Ourworld wifi cafe][4]
Homestay - government water / water board line. Technically it comes out of a tap but it is not standard "tap water". It is a safe drinking water line approved by the Sri Lanka government.

## Dickwella/Hiriketiya
Stay at [Peak house][5] for all your free filtered water needs!

## Path forward

Everybody can help stop plastic bottles and straws are pulluting our landscapes and choking our oceans! Single-use plastic bottles and straws are completely unnecessary. It is possible for almost every accomodation provider and restaurant to provide clean drinking water and re-usable straws (if any straw is necessary) for their customers at very low cost.

For example, if you already have clean drinking-quality water supply for the kitchen, why not use it for drinking? If you already provide re-usable glasses and cutlerly, why not a re-usable straw? It is really that simple.

But a conscious effort is needed to move away from the single-use plastic habit we have all developed.

## Getting the message out

So now you know, its up to all of us to blow this single-use bottled water myth right out of the water!

Anybody traveling Sri Lanka can use https://getwater.lk and share it with friends. 

Would you find it useful if Trip Advisor, Booking.com, Google Reviews, AirBNB and so on listed "water re-fill station" as a facility provided by the accomodation or restaurant? Send them some feedback and help get this added as a feature!
