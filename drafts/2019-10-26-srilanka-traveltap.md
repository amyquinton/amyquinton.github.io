*Written by Amy Quinton and Daniel Newman*

Have you ever assumed that if it's not safe to drink the tap water while traveling, then you must rely on single-use bottled water? We did! But the great news is this is no longer the case. Better options exist, and smart, responsible travellers around the world are seeking them out.

Here we share our insights to help you join your fellow travellers in giving single-use plastic bottles the flick. 

## Sri Lanka hydration guide

At the start of [our Sri Lanka trip][7] the number of plastic bottles we were consuming was growing at an alarming rate. We thought there must be a better way. And there was! 

We found there are actually numerous clean water options (some more obvious than others) that allowed us, like many other travellers, to significantly reduce our single-use plastic bottle waste. 

### Personal purifier

Before we get into Sri Lanka's network of water refill stations, if you're planning ahead for longer term or regular travel bringing your own water purifier bottle or system is still a great option (like a steri-pen). We now use [“Travel Tap” water purifying systems][1] which we find very versitile and convenient, and there are plenty of other choices available.

But if you don’t have one of these magical personal water purifiers, never fear. Check out our tips below for staying hyrated in Sri Lanka without leaving a trail of plastic pollution behind you.

### GetWater.Lk

"GetWater.lk"  has started documenting the network of water refill stations options around Sri Lanka to help travellers avoid single-use bottles. You can check out their website and use their nifty map to find water refill options near you. You can also contribute by adding additional clean water refill treasures that you discover during your travels. 

Many of the places we found to re-fill our bottles weren't yet recorded, so we added them. With this in mind, it's definitely worth asking and looking around if Getwater doesn't show options near you.

Below we share a few places to refill, and things we learn along the way about water in Sri Lanka. 
 

### Arugambay

On the main street in Arugambay you will find a free water refill station called [WLAB][6] It was actually these guys who started the Getwater.lk initiative mentioned above!:droplet:

We also found refreshing cold water served in a re-fillable glass bottle at restaurants like Spice Trail on the main road (picture of menu below).

### Sigiriya

There are at least two re-fill stations here, one in the Village and one inside the main entrance to Lion Rock.

We first stumbled across a water station outside the school in Sigirya Village. We took our bottles and refilled them before visiting Lion Rock. We could have saved ourselves the extra walk however because on arrival to Lion Rock we discovered there was another refill station inside the main tourist entrance! 

 Hopefully it is only a matter of time before it is more widely publicised.

### Anuradhapura

You can refill at many of the local general stores in town for only 3 LKR per litre. Who knew?! A 1.5 litre plastic bottle costs between 70-150 rupees, so 3 LKR is quite a saving!

#### How we discovered this
We asked if the guest house had a verified clean water line like some other places we had visited. Our host said that wasn’t available at the property, and told us he re-fills his water drums in town for 3 LKR per litre. He took us to the general store to re-fill our water that afternoon (on our way to sightseeing) and even lent us one of his 7 litre drums to use during our stay. 

So an easy option is to ask your accommodation where to refill, or if you can refill from their clean water supply (Depending on the situation, you could offer a small amount to cover water costs).

### Unawatuna Beach, Galle
[The hideout cafe and restaurant][3] offers free water bottle refills for patrons. If you just need water, we're sure they would happily refill your bottle for a small fee. 


## I'd tap that!

Not all tap water in Sri Lanka is created equal. While you can't drink from just any tap, most accomodation and restaurants actually have a "government" or "waterboard" line that provides clean drinking water to the property. Technically it comes out of a tap but it is not standard "tap water". It is a safe drinking water line approved by the Sri Lanka government.

This was a big surprise to us. We started to ask our accomodation if they had a "government line". Often they did and were happy to refill our bottles for us. We understand some travellers may be wary, but we drank government line water without any issues, including in Trincomalee, Galle and Mirissa.

Below are some places we found government line water, as well as filtered/mineral water options

### Trincomalee

[Verified clean water lines][2] are installed at most accomodation and restaurants in the area. Just ask your accomodation for access to their verified clean water line where you can re-fill your bottle for free. The water tasted fine and we had no issues :thumbsup: It is important to ask otherwise restaurants/accomodation assume tourists whould rather single-use plastic bottles :thumbsdown:

#### How we discovered this
It was actaully a beachfront restaurant owner who first told us about this. He was concerned about plastic pollution, as were we, and he told us most properties actually at least one verified clean water line. This was locally called a '[sofia line][2]’  (or something like that!) after the french water company that installed line. A what in the who know?! How did we not know about this?! We asked our guest house and sure enough they had a line and showed us where we could refill our bottles with clean, safe water for free!  It was separate water line to the guest rooms and there was one available outside and one in the Kitchen. They told us it was mandatory for them to have that water line:potable_water:


### Mirissa

We asked our friendly hosts at Homestay if they had a government / Water Board line we could refill from. They were very obliging and refilled our bottles for us.  If you are open to trying this option, definitely ask your accomodation about it!

[Ourworld wifi cafe][4] also offers filtered water refills for a small fee (40 ruppees/litre in October 2019)

### Dickwella/Hiriketiya

Stay at [Peak house][5] for all your filtered water needs! We enjoyed the water filter hear so didnt need to ask for government line water, however our host told us that most properties in the area have a government water line.


## Path forward

*Let's blow this single-use bottled water myth right out of the water!*

Smart travellers in Sri Lanka and around the world are seeking out alternatives to unnecessary and harmful single-use plastics. Forward thinking businesses and organisations are already offering solutions. Others are still developing the awareness and resources to do so.

Platforms like Getwater.lk are helping connect travellers with solutions.

So, now you know, join your fellow travellers in kicking the single-use plastic habit. Support organisations offering solutions and let locals know you want to help keep their country beautiful and ocean life healthy by not leaving a trail of plastic waste behind you.

### Water Refill Station Travel App feature

Would you find it useful if patforms like Trip Advisor, Booking.com, Google Maps, AirBNB etc listed "water re-fill station" as a facility at the accomodation/restaurant/area? If so send them some direct feedback or let us know in the comments below to help get this added as a feature!
