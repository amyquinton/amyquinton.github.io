description: Find clean drinking water in Sri Lanka, without single-use disposable plastic bottles

*Written by [Amy Quinton][14] and [Daniel Newman][15]*

Have you ever assumed that if it's not safe to drink the tap water while traveling, then you must rely on single-use bottled water? We did! But the great news is this is no longer the case. Better options exist, and smart, responsible travellers around the world are seeking them out.

Here we share some insights from our experiences travelling in Sri Lanka to help you join your fellow travellers in giving single-use plastic bottles the flick. 

## Sri Lanka hydration guide

At the start of [our Sri Lanka trip][7] the number of plastic bottles we were consuming was growing at an alarming rate. We thought there must be a better way. And there was! 

We found there are actually numerous clean water sources (some more obvious than others) that allowed us to significantly reduce our single-use plastic bottle waste. 

>### Personal purifier <br>
>Before we get into Sri Lanka's network of water refill stations, a quick note on personal filter and purifier options. If you're planning ahead for longer term or regular travel, having your own water purifier bottle or system can be a great way to cover your hydration needs. We now use [“Travel Tap” water purifying systems][1] which we find very versitile and convenient, and there are plenty of other choices available.

>But if you don’t have one of these magical water purifiers, never fear. Check out our tips below for staying hyrated in Sri Lanka without leaving a trail of plastic pollution behind you.

### GetWater.Lk

[GetWater.lk][8] documents the network of water refill stations options around Sri Lanka to help travellers avoid single-use bottles. You can check out [Get Water's website][8] and use their nifty map to find water refill options near you. You can also [contribute][8] by adding additional clean water refill treasures that you discover during your travels. 

Many of the places we found to re-fill our bottles weren't yet recorded by Get Water. With this in mind, it's definitely worth asking and looking around if [Getwater.lk][8] doesn't show options near you, and if you find new options, add them!

Below we share a just few of the many places to refill, and things we learn along the way about water in Sri Lanka. 
 
### Arugambay

**Waste Less ABay**

On the main street in Arugambay you will find a free water refill station called [WLAB][6]. You can also drop off pastic water bottles for recycling there! It was actually [WLAB][6] who started the [Getwater.lk][8] initiative mentioned above!:droplet:

**Restuarants - eg Spice Trail**

We also found refreshing cold water served in a re-fillable glass bottle at restaurants like Spice Trail on the main road through Arugambay (picture of menu below).

### Sigiriya

There are at least two re-fill stations here, one in the Village and one inside the main entrance to Lion Rock.

>#### *How we discovered this*
>We first stumbled across a water station outside the school in Sigirya Village. We took our bottles and refilled them before visiting Lion Rock. We could have saved ourselves the extra walk however because on arrival to Lion Rock we discovered there was another refill station inside the main tourist entrance! Hopefully it is only a matter of time before these are more widely publicised.

### Anuradhapura

You can actually refill at many of the local general stores in town for only 3 LKR per litre. Who knew?! A 1.5 litre plastic bottle costs between 70-150 rupees, so 3 LKR is quite a saving!

The photo below shows kind of water tank to look for. This particular place was located on Niwanthaka Chethiya Road, Anuradhapura.

>#### *How we discovered this*
>We asked if the guest house had a verified clean water line like some other places we had visited. Our host said that wasn’t available at the property, and told us he re-fills his water drums in town for 3 LKR per litre. He took us to the general store to re-fill our water that afternoon (on our way to sightseeing) and even lent us one of his 7 litre drums to use during our stay. 
>
>So an easy option is to ask your accommodation where to refill, or if you can refill from their clean water supply (depending on the situation, you could offer a small amount to cover water costs, although we've found this is usually not expected).

### Unawatuna Beach, Galle

**Hideout**

[The hideout cafe and restaurant][3] offers free water refills for patrons. We thoroughly enjoyed the tacos, burritos and bountry cake here! If you just need water, we're sure they would happily refill your bottle, maybe for a very small fee.

## I'd tap that!
#### *A note on "tap water":*
>Not all tap water in Sri Lanka is created equal. While you can't drink from just any tap, most accomodation and restaurants actually have a special water line providing safe drinking water. It's generally referred to as a "Government" or "Water Board" water line. Technically it comes out of a tap but it is not standard "tap water". It is a potable water line verified by the [Sri Lankan Water Board][9].
>
>This was a big surprise to us. We started asking our accomodation if they had a Government water line. Often they did and were happy to refill our bottles for us. We understand some travellers may be wary. Ultimately you must assess the risk for yourself, all we can say is that we drank a lot of Government line water without any issues, including in Trincomalee, Galle and Mirissa.

Below we share some information about water in these places, including for Government water line and filtered/mineral water options.

### Trincomalee

[Verified clean water lines][2] are installed at most accomodation and restaurants in the area. Ask your accomodation if you can use their government water line to re-fill your bottle.  

The water tasted good and we had no issues :thumbsup: It is important to ask otherwise restaurants/accomodation assume tourists whould rather single-use plastic bottles :thumbsdown: 

Sometimes we find it helps to explain we are trying to use less plastic to avoid leaving plastic pollution behind us when we travel. Our hosts have been very responsive to this and happy to accomodate this request! But if a host is reluctant or doesnt understand our request, of course we respect that too.

>#### *How we discovered this*
>It was actaully a beachfront restaurant owner who first told us about this. He was concerned about plastic pollution, as were we, and he told us most properties in the area have at least one verified clean water line. A what in the who know?! How did we not know about this?! He went on to tell us that this was locally called a '[sofia line][2]’ (or something sounding like that!) after the french water company that installed the water infrastructure. We asked our guest house and sure enough they had a line and showed us where we could refill our bottles with clean, safe drinking water!  There were separate water lines to the guest bathrooms and there was only one drink safe 'sofia line' available outside and another one in the kitchen. The hotel owners told us it was mandatory for them to have that water line:potable_water:

### Galle

#### *Service water at resturants*

We had dinner at [Pedlar's Inn Cafe and Restaurant][10] and coffee at [Heritage Cafe and Bistro][11]. Both provided glasses of water free of charge. If you have your water bottle with you, you could ask your restaurant to re-fill it for you.

>#### *How we discovered this*
>At Pedlar's Inn Cafe and Restaurant we noticed Sri Lankan people had glasses of water on their table and asked the waiter for the same. We're not sure if it was from the Government line or mineral water, but it tasted fine and quenched our thirst. 
>
>Our experience is that reputable establishments in Sri Lanka have water sanitation practices in place to prepare food, fresh juices etc. After enjoying drinks like Lime Juice that clearly had added water, we started to trust that water served at these venues would also be fine. And after 6 weeks and counting traveling in Sri Lanka, so far so good!

### Mirissa

We asked our friendly hosts at our Homestay ([Sun Ray Rest][13]) if they had a Government / Water Board line we could refill from. They were very obliging and refilled our bottles for us.  If you are open to trying this option, definitely ask your accomodation about it!

### Dickwella / Hiriketiya

Stay at [Peak house][5] for all your filtered water needs! We enjoyed the water filter here so didn't need water from the Government line, however the host told us that most properties in the area do have a Government water line. 

[Verse Collective][12] is trendy space in Dickwella that provides table water in re-fillable glass bottles rather than plastic.

## Winning the water game

*Time to blow this single-use bottled water myth right out of the water!*

Smart and experienced travellers around the world are seeking out alternatives to unnecessary and harmful single-use plastics. Forward thinking businesses and organisations are already offering solutions. Others are still developing the awareness and resources to do so.

So, now you know, join your fellow travellers in kicking the single-use plastic habit. Support organisations offering solutions and let locals know you want to help keep their country beautiful and ocean life healthy by not leaving a trail of plastic waste behind you.
