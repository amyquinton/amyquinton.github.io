We wanted a single, globally diversified portfolio filtered for environmental, social, and governance ([ESG][1]) considerations and based upon the *all-weather investment principles*. This kind of portfolio, designed to manage down-side risk in any economic environment, has received increased interest since the strong economic downturn associated with COVID-19.

This blog shares our attempt at implementing this strategy using securities available on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The result is an ESG-conscious all-weather portfolio that is diversified across global geographies and risk balanced across asset classes. We are refining our strategy over time, and the portfolio shared here caputures our current approach.

You can find the story behind why we chose this approach and our methodology for developing such a portfolio in our August 2019 article - [Global-All-weather-portfolios-investment-adventures-of-an-Aussie-couple][2].  

Also check out [Dan’s recent update][3] including new data from the past 8 months showing how the strategy outlined in the August 2019 blog has performed during the COVID19 epidemic. 

### So without further ado, here is our global, ESG filtered, all-weather portfolio
The table below shows the securities and weights for each asset in our globally diversified, ESG filtered all-weather investment portfolio via the ASX. 

**Table 1.** *Our global ESG all-weather portfolio*
<a name="table-1-link"></a>

|ASX ticker |Portfolio Weight |Asset Class |Region|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|VESG |19.2%|Equities |International (Developed Markets)|
|FAIR |6.0%|Equities |Australian|
|VGE |2.4%|Equities  |International (Emerging Markets)|
|VIF |40.0%|Government Bonds (medium term)|International (Emerging Markets)|
|GSBE47* |4.0% |Government Bonds (long term)|Australian|
|ILB |4.2%  |Government Bonds (inflation linked) |Australian|
|IGB |3.0%|Government Bonds (medium term)|Australian|
|IHEB  |8.0%|Emerging Market Credit|International (Emerging Markets) |
|PMGOLD |7.0%|Gold|Universal|
|QCB |6.2%|Commodities|Universal|

The portfolio’s equities and bonds exposure are 20 percent Australian and 80 percent international. The 100 percent equities benchmark in the plot below is also 20 percent Australian and 80 percent international (20% [VAS][4]; 80% [VGS][5]). 

Figure 1. below shows how this portfolio has performed compared to a 100 percent equities benchmark. It shows that out global ESG filtered all-weather portfolio has had superior returns and smaller drawdowns compared to 100 percent equities since we started investing in and publishing our thoughts on the all-weather strategy in August 2019.

**Figure 1**. *Our global ESG all-weather portfolio has had superior returns and smaller drawdowns than the global equities benchmark since we started investing in and publishing our thoughts on the all-weather strategy in August 2019. The relevant ASX securities and weights the portfolio tickers are shown in [Table 1](#table-1-link). The global equities benchmark is also constructed from ASX securities (20% VAS; 80% VGS).* 

It is important to be clear that we are in no way able to provide financial advice and are not trying to convince anyone this is the right strategy for them. We simply share our research and results in case it is interesting to others. 

#### ESG / responsible investment considerations
We have chosen (developed market) equity funds (VESG and FAIR - see [Table 1](#table-1-link)) which exclude companies with significant business activities involving fossil fuels, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, military weapons and civilian firearms, nuclear power and adult entertainment.   

#### Note on fees

Among other things, it is important to consider the impact of brokerage and other fees on overall portfolio performance. Brokerage fees apply when buying and selling ETFs. Since this strategy involves holding 10 ETFs (see [Table 1](#table-1-link) above), the brokerage fees paid to buy/sell these ETF may be too expensive for smaller portfolios (e.g. portfolios with a total value less than A$50,000) and thus make this kind of strategy less competitive than it is for larger portfolios. 

#### *Long-term Australian Government exchange-traded bonds (ETBs) 

Currently there are no ETFs on the ASX that track long term (over 20 years to maturity) Australian (or international) government bonds. But there are individual long-term Australian Government exchange-traded bonds (ETBs). Of these ETBs we chose to use GSBE47 which matures in 2047 (i.e. in 27 years). [A full list of ETBs is available here][6].  

To maintain exposure to long-term governments bonds we need to periodically update the ETB. For example, we currently hold ETB ‘GSBE47’ which matures in 2047 (i.e. in 27 years). After 2027, GSBE47 will reach maturity in less than 20 years and therefore will no longer be “long term”, so it will be important to replace this with another long-term ETB over time.
